=========================

* This frontend is maintained as a series of `.jade` files in `/` which are compiled to `.html` files using `jade` before publishing on a server.
* To use, please first install `jade` globally with `npm install -g jade` or similar, then run `jade` on each `.jade` file with `jade *`
* The `.html` files will now be in `/`
